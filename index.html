  <p>Every day, monitoring sites stationed across the country record air quality levels, measuring pollutants in the air.
      <br><br>
      Air quality is represented by the Air Quality Index (AQI), which focuses on the health effects someone might experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
      <br><br>
      These AQI levels change day to day, even hour to hour. The more polluted the air, the higher the AQI level. But what is Southwest Florida’s air quality like now, and how has it changed over time?
      <br><br>
      The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks daily AQI data, based on a complete 24-hour calendar day.
      <br><br>
      In order to make this information easier to understand, we’ve charted it. Below, you’ll find daily AQI data for Collier and Lee counties dating back roughly 20 years.
      <br><br>
      Each vertical line in the charts below represent one day. The color of the line corresponds with that day’s general AQI level — the greener the line, the better the air quality was that day. The redder the bar, the worse the air quality was that day.
      <br><br>
      Putting the individual lines together shows a general overview of how air quality has changed over time in Collier and Lee counties.
      <br><br>

      <strong>How the air quality index works</strong>
      <br><br>
      The AQI is made up of values from 0 to 500. It’s broken up into six categories representing air quality conditions, with each category represented by a different color.
      <br><br>
      “Good” air quality conditions, represented by the color green, are when the AQI falls between 0 and 50. “Moderate,” yellow, is 51 to 100. “Unhealthy for sensitive groups,” orange, is 101 to 150. “Unhealthy,” red, is 151 to 200. “Very unhealthy,” purple, is 201 to 300. And “hazardous,” maroon, is 301 to 500.
      <br><br>
      “The AQI focuses on health effects that one may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air,” said Weesam Khoury, deputy media relations manager for the DEP, in an email. “It takes all these monitored pollutants and relates them to a single scale value to communicate air quality.”
      <br><br>
      An AQI value of 100 or less is considered satisfactory air quality, according to the DEP.  Above 100 is when susceptible people, like children and those with pre-existing conditions, might be affected.
      <br><br>
      “The Air Quality Index is a pretty good indicator of when you should be concerned,” said Amy Stuart, an environmental health and science professor at the University of South Florida. “That’s really its purpose, to communicate this idea of, ‘Is this healthy for me?’”

<p><strong>Why air quality matters</strong>
  Good air quality is essential to public health and having a solid understanding of how it’s measured can make it easier to identify how air quality affects everyday life.
  <br><br>
  “It’s good to know about the Air Quality Index in your area, it’s a general indicator of whether or not your air is healthy,” Stuart said. “Perhaps be curious about how the things you do and the places you go affect the air quality you experience.”
  <br><br>
  Florida’s overall air quality has improved over the past decade, Stuart said.
  <br><br>
  “We have had a lot of coal-powered power plants, and they’ve been fairly dirty,” Stuart said. “There were some lawsuits about them, so we’ve done some replacements of our energy production here in Florida and also cleaned up a lot of that, so our air quality has been improving.”
  <br><br>
  In the American Lung Association’s <a href='https://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/'>2019 State of the Air report</a>, Collier County was given an “A” ozone grade, while Lee County was given a “B” ozone grade.
  <br><br>
  According to the American Lung Association, the grades are calculated by assigning increasing weights to the days when pollution levels reach the higher ranges. They calculate the weighted average, then assign grades based on that average.
  <br><br>
  “We need to have air that’s healthy for us to breath,” Stuart said. “It’s something we all breathe a lot of, so we need to make sure it’s healthy and it sustains us.”
  <br><br>
  <strong>How AQI data is collected</strong>
  <br><br>
  Monitoring instruments record concentrations of six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, Khoury said in an email.
  <br><br>
  “The Air Quality Index is based on measurements that happen at particular fixed locations in a regional area,” Stuart said. “So, it doesn’t measure the concentration that your child is being exposed to, it’s measuring a more general sense of what’s the general air quality in an area.”
  <br><br>
  According to the EPA’s <a href='https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/FileFormats.html#_introduction'>description of data and formats document</a>, each of the EPA’s daily summary files include data from every monitor in their database each day.
  <br><br>
  We used daily data from Collier and Lee County monitors dating back roughly 20 years. We looked back to 1998 for Lee County and looked back to 2001 for Collier County.
