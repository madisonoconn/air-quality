# air-quality
I wanted to learn more about using data viz for storytelling, so while interning at the Naples Daily News, I worked with their resident data reporter for guidance on this project. Taking 20 years of air quality data, I examined what Southwest Florida's air quality looked like and how it changed over time. I used Tableau to create interactive charts and wrote an accompanying article for context.

## Project status
Although my internship ended before I finished the project, it provided a great opportunity to learn more about data journalism and tools like Tableau that I can use moving forward.

## Authors
I created this with some help from the newsroom's data journalist Janie Haseman.
